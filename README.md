# Student Management System

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course.  
It implements a **Student Management System** with a GUI interface, enabling efficient handling of student records and subject registration.  
The system provides features such as adding/removing students, registering/dropping subjects, searching for students, and performing subject-related calculations.

## Features
- **Main Window** to navigate between functions
- **Add Student** – register new students with details
- **Remove Student** – delete existing student records
- **Register Subject** – assign subjects to students
- **Remove Subject** – drop subjects from student records
- **Search Student** – locate students by their details
- **Subject Calculations** – calculate and manage subject loads
- Graphical User Interface with easy navigation

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**
  - Linked Lists
  - Arrays
  - File Handling
- **GUI (Qt / C++ based)**
- **OOP Principles**

---

## Skills Gained
- Applied **data structures** in real-world student record management
- Designed a **GUI application** integrating backend logic with frontend
- Implemented file handling for persistent data storage
- Strengthened skills in **object-oriented design**
- Practiced modular programming (separate logic and GUI files)

---

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, MinGW, MSVC)
- Qt framework (for GUI support)

### Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the source files:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp logic.cpp gui.cpp -o StudentManagementSystem
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./StudentManagementSystem
   ```
4. Use the GUI to:
   - Add or remove students
   - Register or drop subjects
   - Search for students
   - Perform subject calculations
